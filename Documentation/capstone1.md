# TCP chat app

- The project will be an executable file using PyInstaller so the user can open the app easily. Once the file is opened, the command line will prompt the user for their username and password. If the user doesn't have an account, they can type a command to create an account.
    - The user will be prompted to create a username and password for the app.
        - The system will not allow duplicates.
        - The app will have its own password standards for added security.
        
- Main menu:

    1. Create a chat room
    2. Join a chat room
    3. Compose a private message
    4. View private chats

- Once the user has successfully entered the chat app, the user will be greeted with a main menu. On that menu, the user will be prompted with 3 options: to __create__ a chat room, __join__ a chat room, and to __compose__ a message (private message).
    - The user can type -in to view the inbox while in the main menu.

### Create a chat room
    - The creator of the room is the __Admin__ of the group by default.
        - The admin is asked to set the name of the chat room and how many people are allowed in.
            - Admins create groups and are allowed to kick clients from the group as well.
        - The group ID will be shown at the top so it can be easy to share.
    - eg. *User selects create chat room*
        - Admin enters a unique name for the chat room.
        - Admin specifies the maximum number of participants.
        - The system generates and displays the group ID with the admin being the only client.

### Join a chat room
    - Upon opening the application, a user that intends to join a chat room will be told the chat room ID, which they can enter to join a specific chat room.

### Chat room experience
    - When a user either joins or creates a chat room, they will be able to send and receive messages. They will see a list of connected clients and also be prompted with a list of commands that can help the user use the app (User Experience commands). Clients that aren't in the chat room can't see the messages happening in the chat room.
        - eg. *User joins chat*
            - Welcome to Osagie's chatroom (#2421)
                - Connected clients
                    - Osagie (Admin)
                    - Bob
                    - Joe
                    - Sally
                    - Brian 
            - Press /q to leave chat
            - Press /l to list connected users
            - To close the group, the admin must leave.
        - When a client leaves for any reason, it will be broadcasted to the other remaining clients.
        - Once the admin of the group leaves the chat, the chat room will close and all of the clients will go back to the __main menu__.
        - User messages will be stored in the database for the group chat.

### Private Chats

- While in the main menu, the user can start a private chat with another user directly by username by selecting compose a message.
- While in the main menu, the user can type in "-in" to view private chat dialogue with other users.

### Database Design

I plan to use SQLite and the schema for this app will have 3 tables where I will be storing data, which are:
- Users table
- Messages table
- Chat Room table

## Users table

The user table will be used to store the ID for easy reference, the username of clients, and their passwords.

| Column Name    | Data Type       | Constraints                                  |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| userId         | INT             | PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, AUTO_INCREMENT, NOT NULL|
| userName       | VARCHAR(50)     | UNIQUE, NOT NULL                             |
| password       | VARCHAR(255)    | NOT NULL                                     |

- The user ID will be INT and will be used as the primary key because it would be the most ideal to target a unique number to identify a client. The user ID will need to be different for each user, so the userID will update with every added entry with the auto-increment constraint.
- The userName will be able to store up to 50 characters. This value will have to be unique so everyone's name can be different.
- The password column will be able to store up to 255 characters. This doesn't have to be unique but every user must create a password.

## Messages

The message table will be used to only store what was said and who sent it.

| Column Name    | Data Type       | Constraints                                  |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| messageId      | INT             | PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, AUTO_INCREMENT, NOT NULL|
| message        | TEXT            | NOT NULL                                     |
| userID         | INT             | FOREIGN KEY on userID                        |

- The message ID will be INT and will be used as the primary key for easy reference.
- The message column will store the content of messages.
- The userID will be an INT and is the same column as the userID in the users table. These tables are tied together so each message can also be tied to its user.

## Chat Rooms

The chat room table will be used to store the roomID for easy reference, the room name, and who created the group. All messages sent in the chat rooms can be seen from the messages table.

| Column Name    | Data Type       | Constraints                                  |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| roomId         | INT             | PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, AUTO_INCREMENT, NOT NULL|
| roomName       | VARCHAR(50)     | UNIQUE, NOT NULL                             |
| adminId        | INT             | UNIQUE, NOT NULL, AUTO_INCREMENT 
            |
### ChatRoom Members
| Column Name    | Data Type       | Constraints                                  |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| roomId         | INT             | FOREIGN KEY                                  |
| userId         | INT             | FOREIGN KEY                                  |

- The roomID will be INT and will be used as the primary key for easy reference.
- The roomName will be VARCHAR(50) and will be used as the primary key for easy reference.
- Inactive chat rooms exist for 1 hour. After the room has been vacant for an hour, the chat room should end.
- When a chat room is deleted, the history remains.
- Chatroom members table is a table to handle many to many relationships.

## Security

My approach for security is to secure the contents of the messages sent. I plan to do this using a Python library called PyCryptodome.

## Commands

- All commands will follow a unified format:
    - /q to quit a chat room.
    - /l to view connected users.
    - /inbox to view private messages.
    - /help to view a list of all available commands.

## Testing

- Test this in a real-world scenario using Virtual Machines and a virtual network.
- Set up the multiple Virtual Machines using Microsoft Azure. The network group will be configured so that the VMs will be on the same network.

I plan to use the Pytest library to test socket connections. These are important test cases to ensure a reliable application.

## Test Cases 
1. Server Starts and Listens
2. Server Handles Invalid Port
3. Client Connects Successfully
4. Retrieving users/messages from Database 
5. Single Client Message
6. Broadcast to All Clients
7. Client Disconnection
8. Multiple Clients
9. Large Number of Connections
10. Client Handles Connection Failure

## Libraries to be Used 
 
- **socket**:
    - Establishes a connection between the server and client over TCP.
    - Sends and receives messages between the server and client.
    - Listens for client connections on the server side.

- **threading**:
    - Allows the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously by creating a thread for each client connection.

- **os**:
    - Manages file paths for storing log files or database files.

- **sys**: 
    - Enables the app to accept command-line arguments for running the server or client.

- **time**:
    - Timestamps messages for logging or display.

- **PyCryptodome**: 
    - Encrypts messages exchanged between clients and the server to ensure confidentiality.

- **sqlite3**: 
    - Stores user information (username and password).
    - Saves chat messages for group chats and private chats.

- **PyInstaller**:
    - Packages the server.py and client.py files into separate executables for easy distribution.
    - Ensures that users donâ€™t need to manually install dependencies.

- **pytest**: 
    - Tests message sending and receiving over socket.
    - Tests database interactions like retrieving user messages.
