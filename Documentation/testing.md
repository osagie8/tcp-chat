### [Wireshark Analysis](/Documentation/capstoneDocs/wiresharkAnalysis.md)

StressTest was performed to simulate multiple chat clients connecting to the server simultaneously

localhost 127.0.0.1

Total test duration: 25.12 seconds
Successful clients: 96/100
Total messages sent: 4000
Messages per second: 159.23

Total test duration: 86.05 seconds
Successful clients: 382/400
Total messages sent: 16000
Messages per second: 185.93

Total test duration: 374.88 seconds
Successful clients: 921/1000
Total messages sent: 40000
Messages per second: 106.70

Total test duration: 517.01 seconds
Successful clients: 2334/2500
Total messages sent: 75000

Over network 0.0.0.0

Total test duration: 53.56 seconds
Successful clients: 200/250
Total messages sent: 6250
Messages per second: 116.70

Total test duration: 104.28 seconds
Successful clients: 374/500
Total messages sent: 15000
Messages per second: 143.85

Wi-Fi throughput shown impacted performance. The graph shows the network throughput spiking to nearly 1 Mbps. During the stress test, these spikes indicated periods of network congestion that could cause
- Increased message latency - messages might take longer to be delivered
- Potential message queuing or backlog on the server
- Delayed responses to clients
- Possible connection timeouts if the congestion persists

Network throughput showed significant variation during testing, which could be a contributing factor to any performance degradation observed when handling multiple concurrent connections.
